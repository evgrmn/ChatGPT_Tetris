# Tetris generated by ChatGPT

The goal of this small project was to achieve a debugged application using ChatGPT. It was assumed in advance that the development of the project is carried out without any knowledge in the field of programming. The developer is not a programmer, but only instructs ChatGPT in simple writing, adding game functionality and fixing bugs.

It took patience and a day of work to complete the task, and as a result, we can conclude that ChatGPT cannot replace a programmer. ChatGPT does not know how to evaluate and test its code. ChatGPT is not a developer, ChatGPT is only a tool in the developer's hands.

It should be added that not all code was made by AI. Sometimes patience ran out and I had to make small edits manually. This could have been avoided, but it would have taken longer. However, it is safe to say that 95% of the code was generated by ChatGPT.

Of particular interest is the development.md file, which contains the history of interaction with ChatGPT.
